<p>This project is a small 3D Game Environment that I use to test out developing 3D games. </p>

<p>Typically this is used to test out concepts.</p>

<p>It is still in development and as such it is still continuously updated.
The build and web demo are updated at the end of each day where work was done on it.</p>

<p>All assets were created by Unity Technologies.</p>

<p>To try it out...</p>

<pre><code>Updates:
April 15, 2014
Finally got a small break from schoolwork:
- added the ability talk to the NPC, added what has been described as,
"a gripping narrative"
- created a few Scripts to create a series of nodes for AI to travel on
(not actually coded in yet)
- created some Scenes for upcoming experiments involving AI and 2D
Physics
- unfortunately, player character's weird turn-run has not yet been
fixed

April 6, 2014
Removed unused files...
...which fixed the Unity Editor crashing
Added an NPC
